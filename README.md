# aromlauncher
A very simple program to help launch vns that have alphaROM. Made to allow launching from [Etupirka](https://github.com/Aixile/Etupirka)

## Building
Prior to building, download the c source files from [inih](https://github.com/benhoyt/inih) and place them next to the `program.c`. Then feed both `ini.c` and `program.c` to your compiler.

## Running
Put both the resulting exe file and example ini file in the same folder as AlphaROMdiE.exe and your game's exe. Make sure to edit the `exe` line of the ini file to the file name of the game/launcher's exe.
